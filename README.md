# Simple AR Game

* This is a simple Augmented Reality Game built for Android using the Unity and Vuforia Engines.
* The game consists of an Image Target on which a Player Model and several Glowing Orbs are formed.
* The Player moves around the Image by touching the phone screen in the required direction.
* There's a Virtual button in the middle of the image which, upon being pressed, randomly spawns multiple orbs.
